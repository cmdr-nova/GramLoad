# GramLoad
A simple Python desktop app that can be run over terminal. Simply specify the profile, add login details (if you want to, but there are some profiles that will require it!), choose a destination folder and start the download! I've packadged this up nice and tidy so that I don't have to explain a million lines on a README on how to make this work.

Simply go to the directory where you've downloaded the package and open a terminal there, then run 
```
pip install gramload-1.0.0.tar.gz
```
Once complete, simply type 'gramload' into the terminal, and fire away.

*Note: I do not condone using this app for nefarious means.*
